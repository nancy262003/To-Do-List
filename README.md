# To-do-list

---





## Overview

The React To-Do List is a simple web application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. Users can add new tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them as needed.

## Features

### Add Tasks

- **Add tasks easily:** Users can add new tasks to their to-do list by clicking on the "+" button or by pressing the "Enter" key after typing in their task.

### Complete Tasks

- **Mark tasks as complete:** Users can mark a task as complete by clicking on the checkbox icon next to it. The task will be visually indicated as completed.

### Track Progress

- **Number of pending tasks:** The app keeps track of the number of pending tasks, making it easy for users to see how many tasks are left to complete.

### Delete Tasks

- **Remove unwanted tasks:** Users can delete tasks they no longer need by clicking on the trash bin icon next to the task.

### Real-time Updates

- **Automatic task count updates:** As users mark tasks as complete or delete them, the number of pending tasks is automatically updated, providing a real-time view of their progress.

## Technologies Used

- React: The app is built using the React JavaScript library, making it dynamic and responsive.
- HTML/CSS: Standard web technologies for structuring and styling the application.
- JavaScript: Used for interactivity and managing task data.
